# save it in bears-stimuli-selection/data AND in bears-stimuli-selection/shiny/data/ 
# (need to save in both locations)

# or the VTT files / the nounCounts files from discourse
# then this file should be updated by re-running 04-join-naming-to-discourse.R.

# Most likely this file will not need to change

# NPhon or lexical frequency, update the input files in that script
